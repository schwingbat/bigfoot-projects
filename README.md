# Bigfoot Projects

Bigfoot Projects is an online graphics request submission, tracking and notification system to replace Bigfoot Marketing's old school paper workflow. Projects stay in a database and can't get lost, while requesters can check their project's page at any time to see where we are on things.

## Database Setup

`users` submit and own `projects` which have `progress_states` and `attachments` and consist of `deliverables` which have `formats`.
